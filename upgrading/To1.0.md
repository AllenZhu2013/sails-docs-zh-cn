# Upgrading to v1.0

### Note:
> Sails version 1.0 has not officially been released, but a beta version is available for those who want to try out new features or get a head start on the upgrade process. This version is already being used in some production applications, it's feature-locked, and it's the final release candidate.  If you're starting a greenfield project, we recommend taking v1.0 for a spin.
>
> But be aware that, until the new version has been formally released, there may still be a few lingering compatibility problems and less than beautiful error messages.  We're actively monitoring this release in a handful of large Node.js/Sails deployments to catch any last-minute performance issues.  In the mean time, we recommend that sensitive production applications continue to use the [latest stable version from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails) for a few more weeks.

### Installing the 1.0 beta

To install the beta globally, run `npm install sails@beta -g`. To install it for a particular Sails app, `cd` into that app's directory, then run `npm install sails@beta --save`.

### Migration guide

For more detailed information about upgrading your Sails app to v1.0, see the [upgrade guide in the 1.0 docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/1.0/upgrading/To1.0.md). Just be aware that this migration guide is a work-in-progress, and may have some gaps in information as we continue updating the docs in the coming weeks.

### Questions?
If you have specific questions or concerns about how the v1.0 release will affect your app, just [send us a note](http://sailsjs.com/contact).
